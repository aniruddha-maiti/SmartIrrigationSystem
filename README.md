# Smart Irrigation System

Automating the farm activities can transform the agricultural domain from being
manual and static to being intelligent and dynamic, thus leading to higher
production with less supervision. In this project, we are building an IoT based Smart
Irrigation System using ESP8266 NodeMCU Module, Soil Moisture Sensor, PIR
Motion Sensor and Rain Drop Sensor. Where the farmer can understand how much
soil moisture is there in the field when it's raining or not and if there are any animals
or intruders entering the field. The farmer will get these all alerts in real-time and
based on these results the water motor will be on or off. Otherwise, the farmer can
change the motor mode from automatic to manual to on or off according to his
choice

 ## Features:
❖ In this project, our smart irrigation system uses a water pump that works in
three modes - Automatic mode, Semi-automatic mode, Manual mode.

❖ It detects any motion in the field, it alerts the user/landowner with a
notification/message (i.e Motion is detected).

❖ It detects rain in the field, it alerts the user/landowner with a
notification/message (i.e It is Raining).

❖ It detects the soil moisture level, it alerts the user/landowner with a
notification/message (i.e Water your plants).

❖ It also detects the temperature and humidity of the field.
